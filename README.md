# PizzaDeliverySystem

Done over winter quarter in 2010-2011 for Software Engineering class. Made in Java.

It was a five person team, where we each had our own development roles. It was supposed to
be an example of the Agile development method. I was assigned to testing coordinator, although,
I had to take on many different roles due to other people in the group failing to keep up with
what they were supposed to be doing. Much of the documentation and main development also fell
upon me to work on; some days I worked with the team lead for 10-12 hours to get everything working.

For the project, the teacher acted as a client in private meetings to give us our goals. We were
required to design a pizza delivery system to where a simulated "customer" could go through the
process of creating an order and then track the distance and length of time it would take to
deliver the order.

Some of the included features were an interactive CLI interface (eventually moving onto a GUI created
using Swing), being able to create and handle multiple orders at the same time, real world time
simulation, testing files, and full documentation. Much of the documentation is not included, because
we also ran a team driven Wiki.
